		<p>In the unlikely event that you&#39;re at the surface and need to get the attention of someone on shore or on a boat, you&#39;ll be glad you have a surface signaling device. Signaling devices are important safety equipment that help scuba divers be seen and heard if they need assistance. The recommendation is to always carry at least two devices â€“ one audible and one visual. Visit your PADI Dive Center or Resort to get advice about surface signaling devices.</p>
