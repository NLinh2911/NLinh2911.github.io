		<p>Your SPG displays how much air remains in your tank so that you can end your dive well before you get too low. An SPG can either be a mechanical gauge connected by a hose that reads the pressure in bar (metric) or psi (imperial, pounds per square inch) in your tank, or it may be built into your dive computer. Visit your PADI Dive Center or Resort to get advice about the right SPG for you.</p>
