		<p>A dive knife is a general tool that scuba divers occasionally use to cut entangling fishing line or rap on their tanks to get a buddy’s attention. Some items that fall under this category aren’t really knives at all, but are tools designed for specific uses underwater. Dive knives and tools are not weapons and should never be used to harm aquatic creatures or deface the underwater environment. Visit your PADI Dive Center or Resort to get advice about dive knives and tools.</p>
