		<p>It&#39;s called exposure protection because while scuba diving you’re not only exposed to water&#39;s cooling ability but also to things that can scrape, cut or sting. Because water temperatures vary from really warm near the equator to icy cold in some areas, there are three basic styles of exposure protection – the wetsuit, dry suit, and body suit. Visit your PADI Dive Center or Resort to get more advice about exposure protection. 

			Wetsuits get their name because you still get wet while wearing one. Your body quickly heats the thin layer of water that gets in and you&#39;re insulated from the cooler surrounding water by the wetsuit material. You choose your wetsuit style and thickness based on the water temperature where you&#39;ll dive.</p>
