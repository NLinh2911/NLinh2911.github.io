		<p>Whether you&#39;re driving to your local dive site or getting on a plane headed for the tropics, a sturdy gear bag will help you organize, protect and carry your scuba diving equipment. Your main bag needs to be big and tough enough to hold all your gear and stand up to the abuse of salt water. You&#39;ll probably want secondary bags, such as a lightweight mesh bag, for your mask, fins and snorkel, or a padded bag for your regulator. Visit your PADI Dive Center or Resort to get advice about gear bags.</p>
