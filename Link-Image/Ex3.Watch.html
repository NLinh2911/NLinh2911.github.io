		<p>In the 1970s and 1980s, divers wore dive watches because it was the standard way to track bottom time while scuba diving. Today, with dive computers being the norm, divers wear watches as symbols that identify them as scuba divers. A dive watch looks good, tells you what time of day it is, and can serve as a backup dive timer. You can choose a dive watch that is also a dive computer to get both in one unit. Visit your PADI Dive Center or Resort to see a variety dive watch styles.
