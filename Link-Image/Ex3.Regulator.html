		<p>If you think about it, breathing underwater is pretty remarkable, and it all happens because of the regulator. The scuba regulator is a great invention that delivers the air from your scuba tank to you just the way you need it to breathe.

		A scuba diving regulator is the hub of your dive equipment, and links many pieces of gear – your scuba tank to your BCD, submersible pressure gauge (SPG), alternate air source and you. You&#39;ll always remember your first breath underwater using a regulator – it&#39;s thrilling. However, you&#39;ll soon forget it’s in your mouth as you&#39;re distracted by your dive adventures – which is why you need to have a reliable, easy breathing regulator – so you can forget. Visit your PADI Dive Center or Resort to get advice about regulators.</p>
