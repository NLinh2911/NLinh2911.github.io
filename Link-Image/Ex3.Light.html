		<p>It&#39;s obvious that a dive light is necessary to scuba dive at night to help you navigate, see your gauges, and observe interesting aquatic life. But itâ€™s also a good idea to carry a light during the day to peer inside wrecks, see under ledges and light up caverns. You&#39;ll use it on all your scuba diving adventures to look into the cracks and crevices where shy creatures hide. Visit your PADI Dive Center or Resort to get advice about dive lights.</p>
