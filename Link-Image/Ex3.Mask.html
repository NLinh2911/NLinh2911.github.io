		<p>A mask is one of the most important, and personal, pieces of scuba diving equipment you own because it lets you explore with your eyes. You want a good quality mask that fits you well and gives you the best viewing area possible, because you don&#39;t want to miss anything underwater. Visit your PADI Dive Center or Resort to try on a scuba mask.</p>
