		<p>High-pressure cylinders are relatively small, yet very strong containers that hold large volumes of compressed gas. Being able to carry your gas supply with you is what defines SCUBA (self containedunderwater breathing apparatus). Whether it&#39;s filled with regular filtered air or enriched air nitrox (higher oxygen and lower nitrogen content) or trimix (three-gas combination) for technical diving, a scuba tank is one of the most important pieces of gear. Visit your PADI Dive Center or Resort to get advice about tanks.</p>
