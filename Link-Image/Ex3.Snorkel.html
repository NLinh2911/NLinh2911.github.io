		<p>A snorkel is a very personal piece of equipment. It lives with your mask, spends time in your mouth, and lets you breathe while you look below, until you&#39;re ready to submerge on scuba. Whether you use your snorkel a lot while exploring the local dive site between scuba dives, or just occasionally to swim back to the boat after surfacing, you&#39;ll appreciate that it makes your surface time easier. Visit your PADI Dive Center or Resort to check out different snorkels.</p>
